# FireBoyWaterGirlTAS
Tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) for Fireboy and Watergirl 1 - The Forest Temple

This speedrun works by reverse-engineering the game's `.swf` file and directly injecting a frame-by-frame sequence of controls.
These controls and the order at which levels should be completed are written by hand in an intermediary representation (found in `/tas`) before injection.
